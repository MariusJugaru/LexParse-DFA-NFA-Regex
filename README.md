# Regex to DFA/NFA Conversion and Lexer/Parser Implementation

## Overview
This project implements a series of steps to convert a **Regex** into a **NFA** to a **DFA**.
The project follows a structured approach to handle lexical analysis **(Lexer)** and parsing of lambda expressions. The key stages are:

1. **NFA to DFA Conversion** using the Subset Construction algorithms.
2. **Regex to NFA Conversion** using the Thompson construction algorithm.
3. **Lexer Implementation** for tokenizing input based on regular expressions.
4. **Parser for Lambda Expressions** based on a simple grammar.
